Overview
===========
This app can be used to monitor the delivery performance of virtual numbers for an SMS gateway.
When an expected message isn't received on a virtual number within a configurable timeframe the sysadmin will receive an email and/or SMS.

Usage
===========
1) Copy the beans-template.xml file to beans-xml. Configure beans.xml with credentials, numbers to test, etc
2) Deploy to openshift or JBoss 7.1.1. Untested on other JEE6 servers.

Notes
===========
- The VirtualNumberCheckExecutor is the main execution process of the app. It is executed by a timer.
- The state of all the checks are held in CheckStateStore
- REST endpoint for Delivery Receipt and Inbound SMS push processing located at <context>/rest/process. See classes in package com.smspl.mc4.monitoring.virtualnumber.rest

TODO
===========
1) Implement an error notifier
2) Set up test framework (yes this should be done first!)
4) Set up service to determine frequency of checks based on time of day
5) Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
